# Components

# Common Components

This directory contains reusable, generic components that can be shared across different parts of the application or even multiple applications.

## Purpose
- Houses reusable UI components, utilities, and other common elements
- Promotes code reusability and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
- Maintains consistency across the application(s)

## Usage
- Components in this folder should be:
  - Generic and not tied to specific business logic
  - Well-documented and maintainable
  - Easily importable and implementable
  - Following consistent patterns and styles

## Contrast with Modules
Unlike the Modules folder which contains feature-specific components, this directory focuses on application-agnostic, shared components that can be used anywhere in the project ecosystem.
